# ROP (Return-Oriented Programming) Attack

In this project, you will produce return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks. You will use ROPGadget tool (https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget) to extract gadgets from the target binary and library. Then you will compose exploits that you can launch ROP attacks to the target program.

Your target is still the vulnerable ls program, which I believe you are all very familiar with. You can reuse your previous scripts. Your task is to spawn a shell using ROP.
